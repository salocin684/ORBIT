# Orbital Real-time Behavior and Impact Tracker

## Project Overview

ORBIT aims to create a system that tracks space debris and provides real-time visualization and predictions of potential collisions using artificial intelligence (AI). The project will be built in phases, starting with basic tracking and visualization, and expanding into AI-based collision detection, prediction models, and more advanced features for space debris forecasting.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Space Debris Tracker (Foundation)

The goal of this phase is to establish a core system for tracking and visualizing space debris around Earth. This phase includes acquiring and parsing space debris data, calculating orbital positions, and visualizing debris orbits in a basic format.

**Key Tasks:**

- [x] Research orbital mechanics and space debris behavior.
- [x] Access and use space debris data (e.g., from Space-Track.org or CelesTrak).
- [x] Set up a development environment with required tools and libraries.
- [] Build a system to calculate and track the positions of debris over time.
- [] Create a basic 2D visualization of debris orbits. (Optional)

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Thesis Level)

In this phase, you’ll extend the core functionality by adding real-time tracking, advanced visualization, and AI-powered collision detection.

**Key Tasks:**

- [] Create interactive 3D visualizations of space debris orbits (optional).
- [] Implement real-time tracking by regularly updating debris positions.
- [] Develop a basic algorithm to predict potential collisions between space debris and operational satellites.
- [] Integrate AI or machine learning models to improve collision prediction accuracy.
- [] Implement a notification system to alert users of potential collision risks.

### Phase 3: AI-Based Prediction and Forecasting (Optional/Extra)

This phase introduces more advanced AI and machine learning techniques for predicting the future positions of space debris and optimizing satellite maneuvers to avoid debris.

**Key Tasks:**

- [] Build an AI-based model to forecast future debris positions using historical data.
- [] Implement optimization algorithms to suggest satellite maneuvers to avoid collisions while minimizing resource use (e.g., fuel efficiency).
- [] Explore more advanced AI techniques, such as deep learning models, to enhance prediction accuracy.

### Phase 4: Additional Enhancements (Outside Thesis Scope)

These are optional features that go beyond the thesis scope but could significantly enhance the system’s capabilities.

**Key Tasks:**

- [] Develop a system that uses AI to detect new or untracked debris using satellite imagery.
- [] Allow crowd-sourced data from users to contribute to the space debris database and improve tracking accuracy.

## Project Breakdown

- **Phase 1**: Core debris tracking with 2D visualization.
